A Self-Organizing Maps unsupervised artificial neural network machine-learning algorithm was used to stratify a total of 369 patients with CKD and 46 living kidney donors as healthy controls. Unbiased stratification of the discovery cohort resulted in identification of four novel molecular categories of disease termed CKD-Blue, CKD-Gold, CKD-Olive, CKD-Plum that were replicated in independent CKD and diabetic kidney disease datasets and can be further tested on any external data at kidneyclass.org.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic advancements, therapeutic strategies, and prognostic studies of SAAKI. In terms of pathophysiological mechanisms, research has shifted from the traditional renal ischemia-centric view to a multidimensional interplay involving microcirculatory disturbances, immune metabolic disorders, and programmed cell death. Regarding diagnosis, traditional Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria exhibit limitations, whereas novel biomarkers and imaging techniques offer new avenues for early diagnosis. Therapeutic strategies encompass early intervention, hemodynamic management, renal replacement therapy, and targeted therapies; however, controversy persists regarding the optimal timing"

Nowadays, only few experienced urologists are able to recognize the kidney stone types in the images of the videos displayed on a screen during the endoscopy. This visual recognition by urologists is also highly operator dependent. Thus, several deep learning (DL) models have recently been proposed to automatically recognize the kidney stone types using ureteroscopic images.

The mortality rate for CKD is high, and thus, a person with this illness is more likely to pass away at a younger age. Healthcare professionals must diagnose the various illnesses connected to this deadly disease as promptly as possible to lighten the impact of CKD. A quantum machine learning (QML) based technique is presented in this research to help with the early diagnosis and prognosis of CKD. The proposed research comprises four phases: data pre-processing, data augmentation, feature selection, and classification. In the first phase, Kalman filter and data normalization techniques are applied to handle the missing and noisy data.

Accurate preoperative pathological grading plays a crucial role in determining the appropriate treatment for this disease. Currently, deep learning technology has become an important method for pathological grading of RCC. However, existing methods primarily rely on single-phase computed tomography (CT) imaging for analysis and prediction, which has limitations such as missing small lesions, one-sided evaluation, and local focusing issues. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-modal deep learning algorithm that integrates multi-phase enhanced CT images with clinical variable data, aiming to provide a basis for predicting the pathological grading of RCC."

A Self-Organizing Maps unsupervised artificial neural network machine-learning algorithm was used to stratify a total of 369 patients with CKD and 46 living kidney donors as healthy controls.
